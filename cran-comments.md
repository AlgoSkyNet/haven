## Summary

This fix includes a couple of minor fixes in order to cleanly pass R CMD check. There were no changes to the code so I didn't check the revdeps.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.0
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
